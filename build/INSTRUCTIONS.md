## Generating Files

- when you run the program a new program will run where you can edit and print the files
- to print click the menu in the top right, file>print>export, then it should give you a printing prompt


## Names

- Each person's name/number should go in every file that is applicable to them. An eboard who lives in the new 
house will go in the eboard file and the new house file. A pledge who lives in the new house will go in the 
pledges file and the new house file. This is so that you can just look as the room assignments and naively put 
peoples' names in.
- **IMPORTANT: Spaces matter in names. Make sure that there are no unwanted spaces in front of or behind the 
names. If a pledge has an extra space in their name in the pledge folder, he may not be counted as a plege. (Same 
for eboards)**


## Pledges

- Pledge names will be given a timestamp the first time the program sees their name on the list. After 30 days, 
the next time the program is run, their name will automatically be removed from the pledge list
- Its never too late to add another pledge. Their 30 day timer start the first time the program is run with them.


## Details

- Details should be formatted as such: `<label>:<days>:<number of people required>` 
- Ex: Breezeway & Yard & Dumps:MWF:2
- M = Monday, T = Tuesday, W = Wednesday, H = Thursday, F = Friday, S = Saturday, U = Sunday
- The number of people is a maximum of 9
- Its a good practice to make sure there are no eronious spaces
- If there are too few people in a category, there will be details which are missing people. There will also be a 
warning at the bottom of the output file file.


## Printing

- You can print by going to the menu in the top left and hitting file>print
